## WHAT IS THIS?

A web app for listing aircraft currently above your area. It feeds from the [ADSB Exchange API](https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/) and refreshes data every minute.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## HOW DO I RUN IT?

```
git clone https://github.com/Pekmen/air-traffic.git
cd air-traffic
npm install
npm start
```

## WHY IS IT UGLY?

There is not much data for complex UI decisions, and I focused my time on functionality.
